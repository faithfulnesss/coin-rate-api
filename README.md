```touch /var/www/coin-rate-api/storage/subscriptions.json```
3. Set permissions for storage directory:  
```chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/coin-rate-api/storage```  
```chmod -R 775 /var/www/coin-rate-api/storage```
# Configuration
Before running the service, you need to configure the API key for CoinMarketCap and the SMTP server. Follow these steps:
1. Open the `.env` file in the project root.
2. Set your CoinMarketCap API key:
